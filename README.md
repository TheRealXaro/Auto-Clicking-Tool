# Auto-Clicking-Tool

My free and user-friendly application designed to automate mouse clicks for convenience.

**Key Features:**
- **Easy to Use:** Simple interface for quick setup and operation.
- **Customizable Click Rates:** Adjust the frequency of clicks to suit your needs.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal impact on system resources.

**Important Note:** While the tool is fully functional, there is a known issue with memory leaks associated with the closing mechanism _(Ctrl + Q)_. Although the application window closes, the program may still remain visible in the task manager. I recommend monitoring your system resources after use. You have to enable the function yourself _(FIXME Comment)_. Every other closing mechanism (Menubar and the window close button on the top right of the window) works just fine without any issues.

Feel free to contribute or report any issues you encounter.
